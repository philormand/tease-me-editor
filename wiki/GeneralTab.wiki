=Description=
Most of the fields on this page are downloaded from milovana if you are creating a tease you only need to fill in title, author and media directory

=Buttons=
==Get File==
Opens a dialogue box which will allow you to select a tease xml file to edit

==Save File==
Kind of redundant because it saves the xml file when you save changes to a page, but if you update fields on this page it saves them.

==Create Upload Directory==
This will create (or overwrite) an upload directory in your media directory, It will copy all the pictures you have actually used from the media directory.
(I added this because I put a load of pictures that I might use in the directory and wanted an easy way to identify which ones I had used)

==Sort Pages==
This will sort the pages in the Page Tree tab in alphabetical order.
(it will put the start page first though)

==New File==
Will allow you to create a new tease xml file

==File Location Save==
Default directory for the tease xml files
