Unzip to a directory and run MWTEdit.exe


settings.xml contains the default directory for the teases
 <Settings directory="z:\tm\teases"/>

With the text editor it sometimes deletes spaces at random. If you put in double spaces  where it has deleted a space it only deletes one. I have not worked out why yet.
