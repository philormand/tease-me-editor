=Description=
This is the main editing page.
The pages in the tease will be displayed on the left.
Pages in Red have Nyx download error information.
Clicking on a page name on the left will display it on the right (this will also change what is displayed on the Page View and text editing tabs).
All editing is done here apart from the text displayed.

The table contains the buttons.
The row with a ** is where you can enter information to create a new button.
Clicking the far left of a row to highlight it and pressing the keyboard delete button will delete a button from the table

=Buttons=

==...==
These buttons will open a dialogue to select image, audio or video files

==Download Error / Delete Error==
When teaseme downloads a tease from Milovana but does not understand the Nyx script for a page it generates error information and store the Nyx code for the page.
The Download Error button will display a pop up with the error and Nyx script that caused it. You can use this to manually correct the teasme xml.
The Delete Error allows you to delete that information once you have manually corrected it.

=Buttons=

==Save Page==
Saves the changes to the page
(Saves the whole xml file so changes done on the general tab will be saved too)

==New Page==
Creates a new blank page.
(will prompt for the page name)

==Delete Page==
Deletes the current page.

==Copy Page==
Will create a copy of the current page.
(will prompt for the page name)

==Split Page==
This will split the current page into 2 pages.
It will prompt for the name of the new page.
It will replace the buttons on the current page with a continue button for the new page.
The new page will be a copy of the original page with the new name.
(I put this in to handle pages where the text on a page was too long and I wanted to split it across two pages)

==Move Up==
Moves the current selected button row in the table up one row

==Move Down==
Moves the current selected button row in the table down one row
