==load==
Opens a dialogue box which will allow you to select a tease xml file to edit

==Save==
Kind of redundant because it saves the xml file when you save changes to a page, but if you update fields on this page it saves them.

==New==
Will allow you to create a new tease xml file

==Exit==
Closes the editor
