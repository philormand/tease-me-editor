=Description=
The pages in the tease will be displayed on the left. Pages in Red have Nyx download error information. Clicking on a page name on the left will display it on the right (this will also change what is displayed on the editing tabs)

This will give you a rough view of what the page will look like in teaseme.

The tease buttons will work if they go to a single page, but not random one.

This page does not display videos
